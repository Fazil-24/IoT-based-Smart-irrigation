Farming is a complex activity, one in which every segment impacts the crop production. In order to achieve a successful crop production, a farmer needs to manage all segments properly. Therefore, after soil preparation and planting are completed, sufficient care has to be taken during its growth phase also. Incorporating Modern technologies like Machine Learning and wireless IoT can improve the quality and quantity of crops thus providing a enhanced food processing supply chain. This project mainly aims to automate the flow of water/fertilizers to the plants and crops with the help of IoT.  This Machine learning model helps to identify the type of problem associated with plant.
